# sweetbot

## description
sweetbot is a reusable front end chatbot library that works out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

## tools
- react, webpack
- karma, mocha, chai, enzyme

## development
- everything is unit tested
- everything is documented
- every feature is demonstrated

## features
- local persistance: persisted after session (may be continued after closing all tabs), persisted during session (may be continued in another tab), not persisted (session only exists in current tab)
- user may always delete any session manually
- minimized/hidden views: icon, rectangular tab, or off-screen
- customization: initially this is going to be super minimal.
